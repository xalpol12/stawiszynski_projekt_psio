TODO: 

- [ ] add gameover state (and fun music to a death screen)
- [ ] add audio effects and music (create audioManager?)
- [ ] add options in main menu (map picker, mute sounds, mute music)
- [ ] add modifiers and pickup items
- [ ] add more enemies (one type of enemy is not enough huh?)
- [ ] fix player animations (kinda glitchy rn)
- [ ] add delta time to every frame-dependent actions (it's tedious and i kinda dont want to do this so its at the bottom of the list)
